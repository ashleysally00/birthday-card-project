# Code of Conduct

## Welcome to The Birthday Card Project!

Our goal is to create a fun and supportive space for everyone learning and creating with p5.js. To make sure our community stays welcoming and friendly, we ask that you follow these simple guidelines.

## Our Promise

We’re dedicated to keeping our project a place where everyone feels safe, respected, and included. We promise to do our best to ensure that participating in this project is a positive experience for everyone, no matter who you are or where you come from.

## What We Love to See

Here’s how you can help us keep things great:

- Be kind and respectful to others.
- Encourage and support your fellow creators.
- Offer helpful feedback and be open to receiving it.
- Share your knowledge and enjoy learning together.

## What to Avoid

Let’s keep it positive by avoiding:

- Any kind of harassment or personal attacks.
- Disruptive behavior that makes others uncomfortable.
- Inappropriate or offensive content.
- Anything that makes people feel unwelcome.

## How to Report Problems

If you see something that doesn’t feel right or makes you uncomfortable, please let us know! You can report it by creating an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-repo/issues). We’ll take it from there and work to make things right.

## What Happens Next

We’re here to make sure everything runs smoothly. If someone’s behavior isn’t in line with our Code of Conduct, we’ll address it fairly and promptly. Depending on the situation, this could include removing their contributions or banning them from the project.
