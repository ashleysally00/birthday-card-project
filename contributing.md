# Contributing to the Birthday Card Project

Thank you for being a contributor to the Birthday Card Project! We're excited to see your creative birthday card designs. This guide will walk you through the process of adding your card to our project.

## Important Note on Contributing

Contributors cannot directly add files to this repository. Instead, we use the fork and pull request model, which allows us to review all contributions before they're added. Here's an overview of the process:

1. You'll create a copy (fork) of this project on your own GitHub account.
2. Make your changes in your fork.
3. Submit a pull request to have your changes reviewed and potentially added to the main project.

Don't worry if this sounds complicated - we'll guide you through each step!

## Step-by-Step Contribution Guide

### 1. Fork the Repository

- Go to the [Birthday Card Project repository](https://github.com/ashleysally00/the-birthday-card-project).
- Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page.
- This creates a copy of the project in your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

- On your fork's GitHub page, click the "Code" button and copy the URL.
- Open a terminal on your computer.
- Run: `git clone [URL you just copied]`
- This downloads your fork to your computer.

### 3. Create a New Branch

- Navigate into the project folder: `cd the-birthday-card-project`
- Create a new branch: `git checkout -b new-card-yourname`
  (Replace 'yourname' with your name or any identifier)

### 4. Add Your Card

- Create your p5.js birthday card sketch.
- Save it in the `examples` folder with a unique name (e.g., `yourname-birthday-card.js`).

### 5. Commit Your Changes

- Stage your new file: `git add examples/yourname-birthday-card.js`
- Commit the change: `git commit -m "Add new birthday card by [Your Name]"`

### 6. Push to Your Fork

- Push your changes: `git push origin new-card-yourname`

### 7. Create a Pull Request

- Go back to your fork on GitHub.
- Click "Pull request" (usually shown as a notice after you push).
- Ensure the 'base repository' is the original project, and 'head repository' is your fork.
- Click "Create pull request".
- Fill in details about your card in the comment box.

### 8. Wait for Review

- The project maintainers will review your pull request.
- They may ask for changes or clarifications.
- If approved, your card will be merged into the main project!

## Guidelines for Contributions

- Ensure your p5.js sketch is well-commented and easy to understand.
- Keep the file size reasonable (preferably under 1MB).
- If your card uses any external resources (fonts, images), make sure they are freely licensed and include attribution in your comments.
- Test your card to make sure it works correctly before submitting.

  ## Attribution Options

We respect your choices regarding attribution for your work. When contributing, you have several options:

1. **Use Your Real Name**: If you're comfortable, you can use your real name for attribution.

2. **Use a Pseudonym/Invented Name**: You're welcome to use a creative nickname or invented name if you prefer.

3. **Remain Anonymous**: If you'd rather not be credited by name, you can contribute anonymously.

To specify your attribution preference:

- In your pull request description, clearly state how you'd like to be credited. For example:
  - "Please credit this contribution to Jane Doe"
  - "Please credit this to @CoolCoder123"
  - "I'd like to remain anonymous for this contribution"

This information will be used to properly credit your work in the project, such as in a contributors list or in the gallery of birthday cards.
